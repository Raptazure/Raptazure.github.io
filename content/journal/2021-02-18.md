## Thoughts

> Absurdism is the belief that a search for meaning is inherently in conflict with the actual lack of meaning, but that one should both accept this and simultaneously rebel against it by embracing what life has to offer.

宇宙似乎并没有目的，正因为如此，我们可以自由地选择自己所认同的「意义」。

不要害怕，不要愧疚，万物的终极将归于虚空，而永远也只是闭上双眼的一瞬。

Everything is meaningless. Everything is meaningful. Embrace the Absurd. Be Free.
