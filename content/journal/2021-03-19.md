## Relational Algebra Basics

- The select operation selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate. In general, we allow comparisons using =, ≠, <, ≤, >, and ≥ in the selection pred- icate. Furthermore, we can combine several predicates into a larger predicate by using the connectives and (∧), or (∨), and not (¬).
- The project operation is a unary operation that returns its argument relation, with certain attributes left out. Since a relation is a set, any duplicate rows are eliminated. We list those attributes that we wish to appear in the result as a subscript to Π. The argument relation follows in parentheses. 
- The Cartesian-product operation, denoted by a cross (×), allows us to combine information from any two relations.
- The join operation allows us to combine a selection and a Cartesian product into a single operation. Consider relations r(R) and s(S), and let θ be a predicate on attributes in the schema R ∪ S. The join operation `r ⋈θ s` is defined as follows: `r ⋈θ s = σθ(r × s)`.
